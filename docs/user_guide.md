### Engine Geometry Parameters

#### Combustion Chamber Length (10-100 cm)
**What it controls**: Primary combustion volume and residence time

```
Shorter Chamber (10-30 cm):
✅ Lighter weight, compact design
✅ Higher frequency operation
❌ May have incomplete combustion
❌ Lower thrust potential

Longer Chamber (60-100 cm):
✅ More complete combustion
✅ Higher thrust potential
❌ Heavier, more complex
❌ Lower frequency operation
```

**Typical Values**:
- Small engines: 20-40 cm
- Medium engines: 40-70 cm  
- Large engines: 70-100 cm

**Design Tips**:
- Start with L/D ratio of 3-4
- Consider weight vs performance trade-offs
- Longer chambers need better structural support

#### Combustion Chamber Diameter (5-30 cm)
**What it controls**: Combustion volume and surface area to volume ratio

```
Smaller Diameter (5-12 cm):
✅ Lighter construction
✅ Faster heat-up time
❌ Limited thrust potential
❌ May have heat transfer issues

Larger Diameter (20-30 cm):
✅ Higher thrust potential
✅ Better heat management
❌ Heavier construction
❌ Structural challenges
```

**Design Guidelines**:
- Diameter largely determines thrust class
- Consider manufacturing constraints
- Larger diameters need thicker walls

#### Intake Diameter (2-15 cm)
**What it controls**: Air mass flow rate and breathing efficiency

**Sizing Rules**:
- Typically 50-70% of chamber diameter
- Must not choke the engine at operating frequency
- Consider velocity limits (typically <100 m/s)

**Common Issues**:
- Too small: Restricts breathing, reduces power
- Too large: May affect resonance tuning
- Should match valve system capabilities

#### Exhaust Diameter (3-20 cm)  
**What it controls**: Exhaust flow, back-pressure, and frequency tuning

**Design Considerations**:
- Usually similar to or slightly larger than intake
- Affects operating frequency significantly
- Consider expansion ratio for efficiency

**Typical Ratios**:
- Exhaust/Intake area ratio: 1.2-2.5
- Start with 1.5 and tune for performance

#### Exhaust Length (20-200 cm)
**What it controls**: Operating frequency (primary factor)

**Frequency Relationship**:
```
Shorter Exhaust (20-50 cm):
✅ Higher frequency (120-200 Hz)
✅ Higher power density
❌ May cause structural stress
❌ Higher noise levels

Longer Exhaust (100-200 cm):
✅ Lower frequency (50-100 Hz)
✅ Better resonance tuning
❌ Heavier, more complex mounting
❌ Lower power density
```

**Optimal Frequency Ranges**:
- Small engines: 100-180 Hz
- Medium engines: 70-120 Hz
- Large engines: 50-90 Hz

### Valve System Configuration

#### Valve Types

##### Reed Valves
```
Characteristics:
✅ Self-actuating, simple
✅ Fast response time
✅ Proven technology
❌ Can suffer from flutter
❌ Limited life at high frequency

Best For:
• Most pulse jet applications
• High frequency operation
• Simple construction

Typical Specifications:
• 2-8 valves per engine
• Individual valve area: 2-15 cm²
• Spring steel or titanium construction
